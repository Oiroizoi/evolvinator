# Old to Modern English
This program attempts to find the expected modern reflex of any given Old English word.
You can try it [here](https://oiroizoi.github.io/old-to-modern-english/).

## How to use
- Enter an Old English word, using standard diacritics (i.e., dots for palatalization and macrons for long vowels).
- Select the syllable on which the primary stress falls.
- Choose the appropriate part of speech. For present participles, select "Conjugated verb".
- The program will output the word's likely pronunciation and spelling in late Old English (circa 900), late Middle English (circa 1400), and present-day General American. You can click on "Expected outcomes" to see additional steps in the word's development, as well as the expected modern RP (British) pronunciation.

## Tips
- Predicted outcomes are more accurate for single-stem words than for compounds. For better results, enter each component of a compound word separately.
- If an Old English word's spelling does not reflect its pronunciation, modify your input to match the pronunciation. For example, enter "ġung" for _geong_ [juŋg].

My program mostly follows the changes listed in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English).
