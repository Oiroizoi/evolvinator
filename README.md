# Evolvinator
This program applies phonological changes to predict the development of historical words.
You can try it [here](https://oiroizoi.github.io/evolvinator/).

## Input instructions
### Old English
- Enter an Old English word, using standard diacritics (i.e., dots for palatalization and macrons for long vowels).
- If the Old English word's spelling does not reflect its pronunciation, modify your input to match the pronunciation. For example, enter "ġung" for _geong_ [juŋg].
- Select the syllable on which the primary stress falls.
- Choose the appropriate part of speech. For present participles, select "Conjugated verb".
- Predicted outcomes are more accurate for single-stem words than for compounds. For better results, enter each component of a compound word separately.
### Classical Latin
- Enter a Latin word, marking all long vowels with macrons.
- Use "u" for the vowel /u/ and "v" for the consonant /w/.
- Use "i" for both the vowel /i/ and the consonant /j/. Its phonetic value will be determined based on its position. (These sounds contrasted in Classical Latin, but the difference is unimportant in the development of the Romance Languages).
- Choose the appropriate part of speech.
- Note that most words in French and Spanish derive from Latin accusative forms (e.g., "canem", not "canis").

## Other notes
- You can click on "Expected outcomes" to see more information, including additional steps in the word's development and outcomes in other dialects.
- In many cases, spellings and pronunciations have varied greatly by region and individual. The ones shown are only representative examples.
- Results will not always be accurate. Incorrect predictions may be due to unexpected word developments or flaws in the program.
- If you find a bug or have other feedback, please create an issue!
